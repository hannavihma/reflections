How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed only the lines that are different between two files


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    No doubt about that!


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    You can make accidentaly typos or other errors that break your code


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    For viewing and comparing different versions of the same file 


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    On a command line


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    Nothing will be lost. You could always go back to older version of the file/code


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	You can quickly compare new and older versions of your file

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

	Pros would be if you intend to forget saving. Cons when saving before finishing a line, function... if the saved file is not executable.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	you can always run teh previous versions that worked and compare it to the version with bugs in it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	for statistical analysis
